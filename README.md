# blog-or-die
A Wordpress plugin. If you don't post within a given period, this plugin will shut down your blog

## Instructions

Blog or Die will disable your blog if you fail to post within a given period after your most recent post. That period can be anywhere from 1 day to 1 year.

Visitors will not be able to read your posts when your blog is disabled. Instead, they will see a black screen with either Blog or Die's default message in white text – I have failed to meet my own expectations and I should be ashamed of myself – or a message of your choosing.

Both the time period and message can be set in Blog or Die's settings panel.

## Installation

- Place the blog-or-die folder in wp-content/plugins/
- You should see Blog or Die listed in installed plugins.
- Configure Blog or Die (Settings -> Blog or Die).
